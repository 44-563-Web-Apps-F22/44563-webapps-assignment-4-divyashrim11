    <p class = "CHORUS"> CHORUS
      <br>
      <br>
    We sail the ocean blue,
      And our saucy ship's a beauty;
          We're sober men and true,
        And attentive to our duty.
        When the balls whistle free
          O'er the bright blue sea,
      We stand to our guns all day;
          When at anchor we ride
          On the Portsmouth tide,
      SWe have plenty of time to play.
      </p>                
       <p>Enter LITTLE BUTTERCUP, with large basket on her arm</p>
                              RECITATIVE

       <p>
        Hail, men-o'-war's men-safeguards of your nation
        Here is an end, at last, of all privation;
        You've got your play—spare all you can afford
        To welcome Little Buttercup on board.
       </p>                       

                                ARIA

          <p> For I'm called Little Buttercup—dear Little Buttercup,
             Though I could never tell why,
          But still I'm called Buttercup—poor little Buttercup,
             Sweet Little Buttercup I!
   
          I've snuff and tobaccy, and excellent jacky,
               I've scissors, and watches, and knives
          I've ribbons and laces to set off the faces
               Of pretty young sweethearts and wives.
   
          I've treacle and toffee, I've tea and I've coffee,
               Soft tommy and succulent chops;
          I've chickens and conies, and pretty polonies,
               And excellent peppermint drops.
   
          Then buy of your Buttercup—dear Little Buttercup;
               Sailors should never be shy;
          So, buy of your Buttercup—poor Little Buttercup;
               Come, of your Buttercup buy! </p>                    
    <h6 class = "BOAT name">BOAT.</h6> Aye, Little Buttercup—and well called—for you're the
  rosiest,
  the roundest, and the reddest beauty in all Spithead.
    <h6 class = "BUT name">BUT.</h6> Red, am I? and round—and rosy! Maybe, for I have
  dissembled well!
  But hark ye, my merry friend—hast ever thought that beneath a
  gay and
  frivolous exterior there may lurk a canker-worm which is slowly
  but
  surely eating its way into one's very heart?

    <h6 class = "BOAT name">BOAT.</h6> No, my lass, I can't say I've ever thought that.

    Enter DICK DEADEYE. He pushes through sailors, and comes down

    <h6 class = "DICK name">DICK.</h6> I have thought it often.<p class = "direction"> (All recoil from him.)</p>
    <h6>BUT.</h6> Yes, you look like it! What's the matter with the man?
  Isn't he
  well?
    <h6 class = "BOAT name">BOAT.</h6> Don't take no heed of him; that's only poor Dick Deadeye.
    <h6 class = "DICK name">DICK.</h6> I say—it's a beast of a name, ain't it—Dick Deadeye?
    <h6 class = "BUT name">BUT</h6>. It's not a nice name.
    <h6 class = "DICK">DICK.</h6> I'm ugly too, ain't I?
    <h6 class = "BUT">BUT.</h6> You are certainly plain.
    <h6 class = "DICK">DICK.</h6> And I'm three-cornered too, ain't I?
    <h6 class = "BUT">BUT.</h6> You are rather triangular.
    <h6 class = "DICK">DICK.</h6> Ha! ha! That's it. I'm ugly, and they hate me for it; for
  you all
  hate me, don't you?
  <h6 class = "ALL">ALL.</h6> We do!
  <h6 class = "DICK">DICK.</h6> There!
  <h6 class = "BOAT">BOAT.</h6> Well, Dick, we wouldn't go for to hurt any fellow
  creature's
  feelings, but you can't expect a chap with such a name as Dick
  Deadeye to
  be a popular character—now can you?
  <h6 class = "DICK">DICK.</h6> No.
  <h6 class = "BOAT">BOAT.</h6> It's asking too much, ain't it?
  <h6 class = "DICK">DICK.</h6> It is. From such a face and form as mine the noblest
  sentiments
  sound like the black utterances of a depraved imagination It is
  human
  nature—I am resigned.

    RECITATIVE

    <h6 class = "BUT">BUT.</h6><p class = "direction">(looking down hatchway).</p> 
But, tell me—who's the youth whose faltering feet
With difficulty bear him on his course?
<h6 class = "BOAT">BOAT.</h6> That is the smartest lad in all the fleet—
 Ralph Rackstraw!
 <h6 class = "BUT">BUT.</h6>   Ha! That name! Remorse! remorse!
   </p>                       
                <p>Enter RALPH from hatchway</p> 
                        MADRIGAL—RALPH

  <p> The Nightingale
  Sighed for the moon's bright ray
    And told his tale
  In his own melodious way!
  He sang "Ah, well-a-day!"

  <h6 class = "ALL">ALL.</h6>                          He sang "Ah, well-a-day!"
    The lowly vale
  For the mountain vainly sighed,
    To his humble wail
  The echoing hills replied.
    They sang "Ah, well-a-day!"

    <h6 class = "ALL">All.</h6>                     They sang "Ah, well-a-day!"
   </p>             
                      RECITATIVE

  <p>       I know the value of a kindly chorus,
         But choruses yield little consolation
           When we have pain and sorrow too before us!
           I love—and love, alas, above my station!

  </p>                            

         <h6 class = "BUT">BUT.</h6> <p class = "direction">

                            BALLAD — RALPH

                        <p>
                          A maiden fair to see,
                          The pearl of minstrelsy,
                            A bud of blushing beauty;
                          For whom proud nobles sigh,
                          And with each other vie
                            To do her menial's duty.
      ALL.                  To do her menial's duty.
  
                          A suitor, lowly born,
                          With hopeless passion torn,
                            And poor beyond denying,
                          Has dared for her to pine
                          At whose exalted shrine
                            A world of wealth is sighing.
      ALL.                  A world of wealth is sighing.
  
                          Unlearned he in aught
                          Save that which love has taught
                            (For love had been his tutor);
                          Oh, pity, pity me—
                          Our captain's daughter she,
                            And I that lowly suitor!
      ALL.                  And he that lowly suitor!
  
                        </p>
    <h6 class = "BOAT">BOAT.</h6> Ah, my poor lad, you've climbed too high: our worthy
  captain's
  child won't have nothin' to say to a poor chap like you. Will
  she, lads?
  <h6 class = "ALL">ALL.</h6> No, no.
  <h6 class = "DICK">DICK.</h6> No, no, captains' daughters don't marry foremast hands.
  <h6 class = "ALL">ALL</h6> <p class = "direction">(recoiling from him).</p> Shame! shame!
  <h6 class = "BOAT">BOAT.</h6> Dick Deadeye, them sentiments o' yourn are a disgrace to
  our
  common natur'.
    RALPH, But it's a strange anomaly, that the daughter of a man
  who hails
  from the quarter-deck may not love another who lays out on the
  fore-yard
  arm. For a man is but a man, whether he hoists his flag at the
  main-truck
  or his slacks on the main-deck.
  <h6 class = "DICK">DICK.</h6>   Ah, it's a queer world!
  <h6 class = "RALPH">RALPH.</h6> Dick Deadeye, I have no desire to press hardly on you,
  but such
  a revolutionary sentiment is enough to make an honest sailor
  shudder.
  <h6 class = "BOAT">BOAT.</h6> My lads, our gallant captain has come on deck; let us
  greet him
  as so brave an officer and so gallant a seaman deserves.

                          <p>Enter CAPTAIN CORCORAN</p>

    <h6 class = "CAPT">CAPT. </h6>            I hope you're all quite well.
    <h6 class = "ALL">ALL</h6> <p class = "direction">(as before). </p>       Quite well; and you, sir?
    <h6 class = "CAPT">CAPT.</h6>             I am in reasonable health, and happy
                      To meet you all once more.
