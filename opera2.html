    SONG—CAPTAIN

<h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6>                  I am the Captain of the Pinafore;
<h6 class = "ALL name">ALL.</h6>                   And a right good captain, tool
                         You're very, very good,
                         And be it understood,
                       I command a right good crew,

                         And be it understood,
                       He commands a right good crew.
                       <h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6>                  Though related to a peer,
                       I can hand, reef, and steer,
                         And ship a selvagee;
                       I am never k
                       nown to quail
                       At the furry of a gale,
                         And I'm never, never sick at sea!
                         <h6 class = "ALL name">ALL.</h6>                        What, never?
                         <h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6>                        No, never!

                  Then give three cheers, and one cheer more,
                  For the hardy Captain of the Pinafore!

                  <h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6>                 I do my best to satisfy you all—
                  <h6 class = "ALL name">ALL.</h6>                   And with you we're quite content.
                  <h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6>                    You're exceedingly polite,
                         And I think it only right
                       To return the compliment.
                       <h6 class = "ALL name">ALL.</h6>                     We're exceedingly polite,
                         And he thinks it's only right
                       To return the compliment.
                       <h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6>                   Bad language or abuse,
                         I never, never use,
                       Whatever the emergency;
                         Though "Bother it" I may
                         Occasionally say,
                       I never use a big, big D—
                       <h6 class = "ALL name">ALL.</h6>                        What, never?
                       <h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6>                            No, never!

                  Then give three cheers, and one cheer more,
                  For the well-bred Captain of the Pinafore!

<p>Enter LITTLE BUTTERCUP</p>

<p>RECITATIVE</p>

<h6 class = "BUT name">BUT.</h6>         Sir, you are sad! The silent eloquence
             Of yonder tear that trembles on your eyelash
             Proclaims a sorrow far more deep than common;
             Confide in me—fear not—I am a mother!

             <h6 class = "CAPT name"></h6>CAPT.        Yes, Little Buttercup, I'm sad and sorry—
             My daughter, Josephine, the fairest flower
             That ever blossomed on ancestral timber,
             Is sought in marriage by Sir Joseph Porter,
             Our Admiralty's First Lord, but for some reason
             She does not seem to tackle kindly to it.

BUT, <p class = "direction">(with emotion).</p> Ah, poor Sir Joseph! Ah, I know too well
             The anguish of a heart that loves but vainly!
             But see, here comes your most attractive daughter.
             I go—Farewell!
[Exit.

<h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6> <p class = "direction">(looking after her).</p> A plump and pleasing person!
[Exit.

<p>Enter JOSEPHINE, twining some flowers which she carries in a
    small
    basket</p>

BALLAD JOSEPHINE

        <p>
            Sorry her lot who loves too well,
           Heavy the heart that hopes but vainly,
        Sad are the sighs that own the spell,
           Uttered by eyes that speak too plainly;
             Heavy the sorrow that bows the head
             When love is alive and hope is dead!

        Sad is the hour when sets the sun—
           Dark is the night to earth's poor daughters,
        When to the ark the wearied one
           Flies from the empty waste of waters!
             Heavy the sorrow that bows the head
             When love is alive and hope is dead!
        </p>

<p>Enter CAPTAIN</p>

<h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6> My child, I grieve to see that you are a prey to
melancholy. You
should look your best to-day, for Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., will
be here
this afternoon to claim your promised hand.
<h6 class = "JOS name">JOS.</h6> Ah, father, your words cut me to the quick. I can esteem—
reverence—venerate Sir Joseph, for he is a great and good man;
but oh, I
cannot love him! My heart is already given.
<h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6> <p class = "direction" >(aside)</p>. It is then as I feared. <p class = "direction">(Aloud.)</p> Given? And to
whom? Not
to some gilded lordling?
<h6 class = "JOS name">JOS.</h6> No, father—the object of my love is no lordling. Oh, pity
me, for
he is but a humble sailor on board your own ship!
<h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6> Impossible!
<h6 class = "JOS name">JOS.</h6> Yes, it is true.
<h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6> A common sailor? Oh fie!
<h6 class = "JOS name">JOS.</h6> I blush for the weakness that allows me to cherish such a
passion.
I hate myself when I think of the depth to which I have stooped
in
permitting myself to think tenderly of one so ignobly born, but I
love
him! I love him! I love him! <p class = "direction">(Weeps.)</p>
<h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6> Come, my child, let us talk this over. In a matter of the
heart I
would not coerce my daughter—I attach but little value to rank
or
wealth, but the line must be drawn somewhere. A man in that
station may
be brave and worthy, but at every step he would commit solecisms
that
society would never pardon.
<h6 class = "JOS name">JOS.</h6> Oh, I have thought of this night and day. But fear not,
father, I
have a heart, and therefore I love; but I am your daughter, and
therefore
I am proud. Though I carry my love with me to the tomb, he shall
never,
never know it.
<h6 class = "CAPT name">CAPT.</h6> You are my daughter after all. But see, Sir Joseph's
barge
approaches, manned by twelve trusty oarsmen and accompanied by
the
admiring crowd of sisters, cousins, and aunts that attend him
wherever he
goes. Retire, my daughter, to your cabin—take this, his
photograph, with
you—it may help to bring you to a more reasonable frame of mind.
<h6 class = "JOS name">JOS.</h6> My own thoughtful father!
